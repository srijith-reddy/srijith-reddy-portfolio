## 🧠 MIRA — Multimodal AI Assistant  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/srijith-reddy/M.I.R.A(Private Build)  
**Medium Article:** https://medium.com/@shrey.maramreddy/building-mira-my-voice-activated-multimodal-ai-assistant-from-scratch-604448979a1a

A fully modular, voice-activated AI assistant with many autonomous agents (BrowserAgent, PlannerAgent, GmailAgent, CalendarAgent, WhatsAppAgent, MusicAgent).  
Includes wake-word detection, GPT-4o vision fusion, trust-ranked browsing, async orchestration, and multimodal reasoning.

## 📊 Quant Research Pipeline (Layered Workflow)  
**Website link:** https://srijith-reddy.github.io/Statistical-Learning-for-Data-Mining-Projects/

Developed as a summer research project, this full-stack workflow builds and evaluates equity alpha factors across multiple time horizons. Integrated OHLCV, options, and macroeconomic data, and applied SHAP- and IC-based feature pruning, ElasticNet ensembles, and Optuna-tuned XGBoost/LightGBM models to forecast 1D/5D/21D forward returns. The pipeline was later extended with HMM-based regime detection and CVXPY portfolio optimization, achieving robust out-of-sample IC and Sharpe improvements.
