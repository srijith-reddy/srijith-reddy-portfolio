# 🚀 Featured Projects

Below is a curated lineup of my most impactful AI, ML, and data science projects.
Each link takes you directly to the project's GitHub repository or article.

## 🧠 MIRA — Multimodal AI Assistant  
**GitHub:** [Private Build](https://github.com/srijith-reddy/M.I.R.A)  
**Medium Article:** [Building MIRA](https://medium.com/@shrey.maramreddy/building-mira-my-voice-activated-multimodal-ai-assistant-from-scratch-604448979a1a)

A fully modular, voice-activated AI assistant with many autonomous agents (BrowserAgent, PlannerAgent, GmailAgent, CalendarAgent, WhatsAppAgent, MusicAgent).  
Includes wake-word detection, GPT-4o vision fusion, trust-ranked browsing, async orchestration, and multimodal reasoning.

---

## 🏠 Housing Price Prediction *(1st Place — University Competition)*  
**Website:** [Housing Price Prediction](https://srijith-reddy.github.io/Statistical-Learning-for-Data-Mining-Projects/project3.html)

600k+ record real-estate dataset.  
Feature engineering + binning + Optuna-optimized XGBoost/LightGBM.

## 🚶 WalkWithMe — AR Pedestrian Navigation & Hazard Awareness  
**GitHub:** [WalkWithMe Backend](https://github.com/srijith-reddy/walkwithme-backend)  
**GitHub:** [WalkWithMe iOS Frontend](https://github.com/srijith-reddy/walkwithme-frontend)

A production-grade pedestrian navigation system combining ARKit, MapKit, and on-device computer vision to support real-world walking with safety-aware routing and hazard awareness.

The stateless FastAPI backend is built around Valhalla and extends pedestrian routing with safety-, scenic-, elevation-, and context-aware ranking via isochrones, elevation analysis with multi-source fallbacks, and GPX export.

The iOS frontend uses RealityKit and ARKit to render world-aligned routes and camera-relative hazard overlays, with turn-by-turn HUDs, a live minimap, and graceful fallback to Apple Maps when AR is unavailable.

The architecture cleanly separates a stateful, tile-backed routing engine from a portable API layer, enabling flexible deployment and real-time AR navigation under mobile constraints.

## 🥊 UFC Fight Prediction — Leakage-Free ML Pipeline & Inference App
**GitHub:** [UFC Fight Prediction](https://github.com/srijith-reddy/ufc_app)
**Website:** [Live App](https://srijith-reddy-ufc-app-app-2grqrv.streamlit.app/)

An end-to-end, leakage-free UFC fight prediction system built under strict prefight constraints, covering data curation, feature engineering, model training, calibration, and deployment.

The pipeline enforces temporal integrity using Glicko ratings, shift-based feature construction, quantile clipping, and log transforms, ensuring all features are legally available at prediction time.

Multiple models are evaluated, with a calibrated XGBoost model achieving strong out-of-sample AUC and well-behaved probabilities, making it suitable for real-world inference.

The project culminates in a production-safe Streamlit app that mirrors training preprocessing exactly and outputs deterministic, calibrated win probabilities for full fight cards.

## 🧠 Sentiment Classification with Neural Networks  
**GitHub:** [Sentiment Classification](https://github.com/srijith-reddy/Sentiment-Classification-with-Neural-Networks)

CNN-based sentiment classification on the Sentiment140 dataset (1.6M tweets).  
Baseline CNN outperformed deeper variants; best test accuracy (79.54%) achieved with a 500-dimensional embedding, showing hyperparameters matter more than model depth.

---

## 🎬 CineSeq — Decay-Aware Seq2Seq Forecasting  
**GitHub:** [CineSeq](https://github.com/srijith-reddy/cine-multivariate-seq2seq-forecasting)

Research-oriented framework for short-horizon movie box-office forecasting.  
Combines explicit exponential decay modeling with multivariate external signals using an LSTM–GRU Seq2Seq architecture.

Builds a leakage-safe weekly panel (2010–2023), validates decay dynamics, and forecasts 4-week revenue horizons.  
Incorporates trailer-based emotion embeddings via transfer learning and interprets predictions using Integrated Gradients.

Attention-based decoding reduces test WAPE by ~41%, with strongest gains for movies exhibiting mid-run deviations from smooth decay.

---

## 🎾 Elo-Based Time Series Forecasting  
**GitHub:** [Elo Forecasting Repo](https://github.com/srijith-reddy/Elo-Based-Time-Series-Forecasting)

ATP tennis forecasting dashboard using ARIMA auto-selection + surface-aware Elo system.  
Forecasts 6–24 month player form and win probabilities.

---

## 🏀 Fair NBA Draft Predictor — FairStacks Ensemble  
**Website:** [FairNBA Draft Predictor](https://srijith-reddy.github.io/Statistical-Learning-for-Data-Mining-Projects/project2.html)

Fairness-aware classification using Naive Bayes, LDA, SVM, Ridge/Lasso Logistic Regression with CVX-based fairness constraints.  
Reduces TPR gaps across school tiers.

---

## 📉 Bias–Variance Tradeoff in Ridge Regression  
**Website:** [Bias-Variance Tradeoff](https://srijith-reddy.github.io/Statistical-Learning-for-Data-Mining-Projects/project1.html)

Simulated Ridge Regression vs OLS under linear and nonlinear DGPs.  
Demonstrated full bias–variance decomposition with clear visualizations showing when Ridge outperforms OLS.

---

## 💳 Payment Method Classification (ML + ANN)  
**GitHub:** [Payment Method Classification](https://github.com/srijith-reddy/Payment-Method-Classification-ML-ANN)

Leakage-free classification of payment method (Credit Card, Debit Card, PayPal) using numerical retail transaction features.  
Multinomial logistic regression outperformed an ANN (≈0.67 vs ≈0.63 test accuracy), indicating limited signal rather than model instability.

---

## 📊 Global Safety Regression Model  
**GitHub:** [Global Safety Regression Repo](https://github.com/srijith-reddy/Global-Safety-Regression-Model)

Analyzing how GDP, internet access, population growth, refugees, and development metrics relate to homicide rates across 169 countries.

---

## 📏 Multivariate Body Fat & BMI Analysis  
**GitHub:** [Multivariate Stats Repo](https://github.com/srijith-reddy/Multivariate-Stat-Methods)

Multivariate regression, MANOVA, PCA, and CCA on physical measurements to estimate body fat % and BMI.
